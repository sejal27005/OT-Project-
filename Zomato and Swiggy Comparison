In terms of user experience, Zomato focuses more on providing detailed restaurant information. It shows a lot of reviews, ratings, and photos, which makes it easier for users who like to explore options before ordering. Swiggy, on the other hand, is designed to make the ordering process faster and simpler, with a cleaner interface.
When it comes to services, both offer food delivery, but Zomato also provides dine-out deals and has integrated Blinkit for grocery deliveries. Swiggy not only has food delivery and Instamart for groceries but also offers Swiggy Genie, which can be used for sending parcels and documents.
For dining offers, Zomato has a special membership program called Zomato Gold, which gives discounts on dine-out and free deliveries. Swiggy doesn't have dine-out deals but offers a membership called Swiggy One, which focuses on free deliveries and better customer support.
Looking at restaurant listings, Zomato is slightly better for premium or urban restaurants and focuses more on metro cities. Swiggy, meanwhile, is very strong in local areas and smaller towns, offering more options from local eateries.
Talking about delivery speed, Swiggy is usually a bit faster and more consistent compared to Zomato, though it can vary based on location.
In terms of customer support, Swiggy is known for faster issue resolution through in-app chat. Zomato also has chat and email support, but the feedback about its responsiveness is mixed.
Finally, if thereâ€™s a problem with an order, refunds on Swiggy are usually processed faster, whereas Zomato might sometimes take a little longer.

Summary:
Zomato is better if you want detailed restaurant information, premium options, and dine-out deals.
Swiggy is better if you prefer quick deliveries, easy ordering, and multi-purpose services like parcel delivery.
