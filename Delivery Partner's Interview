Interview with a Zomato Delivery Partner: Ravi's Story
Ravi, a 27-year-old delivery partner based in Delhi, has been working with Zomato for the past one and a half years. Previously employed at a shop with strict timings and modest pay, Ravi made the switch to Zomato seeking more flexibility. "A friend told me about it, and I liked the idea that I could work whenever I wanted," he shares.
When asked about the positives of his work, Ravi highlights flexible timings as the biggest advantage. He appreciates the ability to choose his shifts — whether in the mornings, evenings, or even just on weekends. On a good day, he mentions he can earn between ₹800 and ₹1200, especially during peak hours and weekends when incentives are higher. Maintaining good customer ratings, he adds, gives him access to priority deliveries, which further boosts his earnings. "For someone like me who doesn't have a high qualification, it’s a job that helps me support my family," Ravi says.
However, the work also comes with significant challenges. Unpredictable earnings are a major concern — while some days are profitable, others are slow, especially during bad weather or low-demand periods. Moreover, delivery partners must cover the cost of fuel and bike maintenance themselves, expenses that eat into their earnings as petrol prices continue to rise. Ravi also points out the lack of job security: as gig workers rather than full-time employees, they do not receive salaries, sick leave, or other protections.
Customer behavior poses another issue. "Sometimes customers behave badly or give low ratings for things beyond our control, like food delays from restaurants," he explains. Such ratings can negatively affect incentives and order allotments. Additionally, changes to the app’s algorithm sometimes result in fewer order assignments, even when riders are active.
In terms of emergency support, Ravi mentions that while Zomato provides a helpline and some insurance coverage, "the claim process is long, and in reality, we mostly manage things on our own."
When asked about how society treats delivery workers, Ravi answers candidly: "Honestly, not always well. Some people are kind, but many look down on us. We work hard, in rain, traffic, and extreme heat, just to deliver food on time. I think we deserve more respect."
Finally, when given the opportunity to suggest improvements, Ravi expresses a hope for a minimum guaranteed income per day or better fuel support. He also wishes for a fairer system to address unjust customer ratings. "That would make things more fair for us," he concludes.
