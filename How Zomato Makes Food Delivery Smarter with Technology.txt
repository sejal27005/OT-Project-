Zomato uses dynamic pricing which means that prices for food and delivery can change based on factors such as demand, time of the day, weather conditions, and the number of available delivery partners.
The platform also monitors competition like Swiggy and Ola Eats by comparing the prices mentioned in the menus, discounts offered, and delivery fees, allowing Zomato to adjust its own strategies to stay competitive accordingly. 
Promotional offers like “Zomato Gold”, seasonal deals, discounts which are available only on the app are used to attract and retain customers.
Zomato’s web and mobile apps are built using React and React Native which helps to create a smooth and user-friendly interface. 
On the backend, Zomato runs mainly on programming languages like Python and Node.js. These help the system handle everything from taking orders to managing restaurant data. In order to store all this information like the details of the customers, order history, and restaurant- they use databases such as PostgresSQL for structured data and MondoDB for more flexible, unstructured data.
The platform runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), using services such as:
EC2 for computing power
S3 for storage like images and menus
RDS for handling relational databases
Zomato uses dynamic pricing algorithms that basically look at the live data like where the order is coming from, how many people are ordering at that time, and how busy the things are overall. Based on this, the app can quickly adjust delivery charges or offer discounts by making the pricing fair and responsive.
Earlier, delivery routes were mostly figured out by the delivery partners by themselves. They used their own experience or the basic GPS apps to find the way. But now, Zomato uses advanced tools that automatically find the best routes and assign the nearest delivery partner and therefore, making the process faster as well as smoother.
Zomato uses technologies like machine learning and predictive analytics in order to make the whole experience smarter. These tools help the app to guess how long a delivery will take, suggest food that we might like based on our order history, and also make sure that everything runs more efficiently behind the scenes.

Hence, overall, Zomato’s terminology stack includes React and React Native for frontend development, Python and Node.js for backend, PostgreSQL and MongoDB as their main databases, and cloud services from AWS like EC2, S3, and RDS for hosting and scaling their operations. Additional tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Maps API further help in making sure that the platform runs quickly and efficiently and it is reliable to use.
